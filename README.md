A service that connects your Eufy Security cameras to MQTT, enabling easy integration with home automation systems like Home Assistant, Node-RED, or any other MQTT-compatible platform.

## üöÄ Features

- üîÑ Connects to the Eufy Security cloud API
- üìπ Monitors all your Eufy cameras and devices
- üö® Detects and publishes events to MQTT:
  - Motion detection
  - Person detection
  - Pet detection
  - Dog detection
  - Vehicle detection
  - Sound detection
  - Crying detection (for indoor cameras)
  - Doorbell rings
  - Package deliveries
  - Property changes
- üîå Maintains persistent connection with automatic reconnection
- üåê Web-based status interface with:
  - Device details and properties
  - Recent event history
  - Captcha entry for login challenges
  - Two-factor authentication entry
- üê≥ Docker support for easy deployment

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 16 or later
- Eufy Security account with cameras set up
- MQTT broker (like Mosquitto, HiveMQ, EMQ X, etc.)

## üì¶ Installation

### Option 1: Running locally

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eufy-mqtt-service.git
   cd eufy-mqtt-service
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Then edit the `.env` file with your Eufy and MQTT credentials.

4. Compile TypeScript:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Start the service:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Access the web interface:
   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or your configured port)

### Option 2: Using Docker

1. Create a `.env` file with your configuration as described above.

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t eufy-mqtt-service .
   ```

3. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name eufy-mqtt -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd)/persistent:/app/persistent --env-file .env eufy-mqtt-service
   ```

4. Access the web interface:
   Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

## üåê Web Interface

The service includes a web interface that provides:

1. **Authentication Handling**:
   - Displays captcha images when required by Eufy
   - Provides a form to submit two-factor authentication codes
   - No need to restart the service when authentication challenges occur

2. **Device Status**:
   - Shows all connected devices
   - Displays device properties and their current values
   - Shows connection status

3. **Event History**:
   - Lists recent events from all devices
   - Shows timestamps for when events occurred

To access the web interface, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured port).

## üîë Authentication Flow

The authentication process is now much easier:

1. Start the service with your Eufy credentials in the `.env` file
2. If Eufy requires a captcha or two-factor authentication:
   - The web interface will automatically show the appropriate form
   - For captcha, you'll see the image directly in your browser
   - For 2FA, you'll get a form to enter the code sent to your email
3. Submit the required information through the web interface
4. The service will continue the authentication process automatically

## üì° MQTT Topics

The service publishes events to the following topic structure:

- `eufy/events/status` - Connection status
- `eufy/events/{device-name}/{property}` - Device property values
- `eufy/events/{device-name}/event/motion` - Motion detection events
- `eufy/events/{device-name}/event/person` - Person detection events
- `eufy/events/{device-name}/event/pet` - Pet detection events
- `eufy/events/{device-name}/event/dog` - Dog detection events
- `eufy/events/{device-name}/event/vehicle` - Vehicle detection events
- `eufy/events/{device-name}/event/sound` - Sound detection events
- `eufy/events/{device-name}/event/crying` - Crying detection events
- `eufy/events/{device-name}/event/doorbell` - Doorbell ring events
- `eufy/events/{device-name}/event/package` - Package delivery events

## üìù Message Format

Event messages are published in JSON format:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-04-25T15:30:45.123Z"
}
```

Property values are published as JSON with the actual property value:

```json
"75"
```

or

```json
true
```

The status message has this format:

```json
{
  "status": "connected",
  "timestamp": "2023-04-25T15:30:45.123Z"
}
```

## üè† Home Assistant Integration

To integrate with Home Assistant, add the following to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
mqtt:
  binary_sensor:
    - name: "Front Door Motion"
      state_topic: "eufy/events/Front Door Camera/event/motion"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.timestamp is defined }}"
      device_class: motion
      off_delay: 30

    - name: "Front Door Person"
      state_topic: "eufy/events/Front Door Camera/event/person"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.timestamp is defined }}"
      device_class: occupancy
      off_delay: 30

  sensor:
    - name: "Front Door Battery"
      state_topic: "eufy/events/Front Door Camera/batteryLevel"
      device_class: battery
      unit_of_measurement: "%"
      
  binary_sensor:
    - name: "Eufy Connection"
      state_topic: "eufy/events/status"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.status == 'connected' }}"
      device_class: connectivity
```

Replace `Front Door Camera` with your actual camera name as shown in the logs when the service starts.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Service not connecting to Eufy**: Check your Eufy credentials and ensure you can log in to the Eufy Security app
- **MQTT messages not being received**: Verify your MQTT broker configuration and test with an MQTT client
- **Web interface not loading**: Make sure port 3000 (or your configured port) is accessible
- **Captcha or 2FA not working**: Try refreshing the web interface and submitting again
